# ChangeChip
<img align="right" width="170" src="CC_logo.png">

ChangeChip was developed to detect changes between an inspected PCB image and a reference (golden) PCB image, in order to detect defects in the inspected PCB.\
The system is based on Image Processing, Computer Vision and Unsupervised Machine Learning.\
ChangeChip is targeted to handle optical images, and also radiographic images, and may be applicable to other technologies as well.\
We note that ChangeChip is not limited to PCBs only, and may be suitable to other systems that require object comparison by their images.
The workflow of ChangeChip is presented as follows:

# CD-PCB
As part of this work, a small dataset of 20 pairs of PCBs images was created, with annotated changes between them. This dataset is proposed for evaluation of change detection algorithms in the PCB Inspection field.
